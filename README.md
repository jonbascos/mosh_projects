Beginner Python projects from Mosh

I'm trying to re-learn Python by following a YouTube video called "Python Projects for Beginnersâ€”Master Problem-Solving! " by "Programming with Mosh." Since I learn more by doing, I thought I'd go ahead and tackle it this way. I do have experience programming in Python, but it has been such a long time since I've coded in Python that I've lost most of it.
